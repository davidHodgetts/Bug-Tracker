# Bug-Tracker
This is a bug tracker project designed and being devoled by me. 

It is planned for this project to consist of:
- A MySQL(MariaDB) database
- A front end web application for bug reporters 
- A back end c# application for developers/users 

Currently, only the database and its ERD have been created. This can be viewd in the database folder. The ERD also reflects how the system is intended to work for admins developers/users as well as bug reporters/customers.
